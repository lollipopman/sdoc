# NTP Master
1. Create the file /etc/inet/ntp.conf with the following    
   entries:
   server 127.127.1.0
   driftfile /etc/ntp.drift

2. Create the file /etc/ntp.drift with the following entry:
   0.0

3. Bounce NTP service.
   #> /etc/rc2.d/S74xntd stop
   #> /etc/rc2.d/S74xntd start

4. Check Status
   #> ntpq
   ntpq> peers

# NTP Clients
1. Create the file /etc/inet/ntp.conf with the following entries:
   server <hostname of ntp server>
   driftfile /etc/ntp.drift

2. Create the file /etc/ntp.drift with the following entry:
   0.0

3. Bounce NTP service.
   #> /etc/rc2.d/S74xntd stop
   #> /etc/rc2.d/S74xntd start

4. Check Status
   #> ntpq
   ntpq> peers


# Notes
# Network Time Protocol (NTP):
- When setting up an NTP config file it is important to reference
  these machines by their aliases and not their canonical names. 
  This allows you to transparently move the NTP servers to other 
  machines in the future.
- The public domain xntp daemon (which uses NTP) is used to sync
  computer clocks.
- The xtnp daemon reads the file /etc/inet/ntp.conf at startup.
  It can be run periodically as a cron job.
- date and rdate can be used on systems that do not use NTP.
- Config NTP Server:
  1. Copy /etc/inet/ntp.server to /etc/inet/ntp.conf
  2. Edit the file /etc/inet/ntp.conf to point to an ntp server.
  3. Change to the /etc/inet.d dir and start the xntd daemon
- Config Client (same):
  1. Copy /etc/inet/ntp.server to /etc/inet/ntp.conf
  2. Edit the file /etc/inet/ntp.conf to point to an ntp server.
  3. Change to the /etc/inet.d dir and start the xntd daemon
- To sync the date and time with another system use:
  rdate <remote host>
- ntpq can be used to show the status of ntp.
