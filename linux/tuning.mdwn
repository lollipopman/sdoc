# max number of open files

The kernel allocates file handles dynamically, but it doesnâ€™t free them again.
If the number of allocated files is close to the maximum, you should consider
increasing the maximum.

    cat /proc/sys/fs/file-max 

    cat /proc/sys/fs/file-nr
    3391    969     52427
    |       |       |
    |       |       |
    |       |       maximum open file descriptors
    |       |
    |       total free allocated file descriptors
    |
    total allocated file descriptors
    (the number of file descriptors allocated since boot)

# increase number of open files

    echo "104854" > /proc/sys/fs/file-max

   - Alternatively, you can use sysctl(8) to change it:

        sysctl -w fs.file-max=65536

   - To make the change permanent, add or change the following line in the file
     /etc/sysctl.conf. This file is used during the boot process.

        echo "fs.file-max=65536" >> /etc/sysctl.conf
