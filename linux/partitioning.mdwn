# Problems

Using fdisk for partitioning can no be sufficient for big drives. For example, it can be used for 1TB but for 2TB partition it complaines for different physical and logical endings.

# big drive partitioning

    parted /dev/sdc
    (parted) mklabel gpt
    (parted) mkpart primary ext3 0 1100GB
    (parted) print

    Disk /dev/sdc: 1100GB
    Sector size (logical/physical): 512B/512B
    Partition Table: gpt

    Number  Start   End     Size    File system  Name     Flags
     1      17.4kB  1100GB  1100GB               primary


    Take notice that parted operates using MB, GB.

# filesystem

  - to not reserve 5% for root use -m0 key for mkfs.ext3
