## Linux Capablities

Capabilties can be set on a program for all users or just for specific users.
To give a capability to user the capability must be given to *both* the user as
well as the same capability set to be inheritable by the program.

### Flags

  - *e*: Effective - Allows a program to inherit a capability from the parent
    process and make it effective
  - *i*: Inheritable - Allows a process to inherit capabilites and provide them
    to child processes
  - *p*: Permitted - Allows capabilities which need not be inherited

### User capabilities

  - get current user capabilities

        setcap cap_net_admin=ei $(which libvirtd)

  - set current program to have `cap_net_admin` for all users
