## Adding a New Server to the Backup Server

To add a server to the backup schedule perform the following steps
on the server:

  1. Create new password for client

        dd if=/dev/random count=8 bs=1 | xxd -ps

  1. Edit /etc/bacula/bacula-dir.conf 

  1. Add the entry: 

        Job {
          Name = "<hostname>"
          Client = "<hostname>-fd"
          JobDefs = "DefaultJob"
          Write Bootstrap = "/var/lib/bacula/<hostname>.bsr"
        }

  1. Add the entry: 

        Client {
          Name = <hostname>-fd
          Address = <hostname>
          FDPort = 9102
          Catalog = PrimaryCatalog
          Password = "<password>"
          File Retention = 60 days
          Job Retention = 6 months
          AutoPrune = yes
        }

To grant access from the backup server to the client perform the following
steps on the client side:

     section in bacula-dir.conf on the backup server 

        Password = "<password>"

  1. Replace FDaddress in File Daemon section with server hostname

        FDAddress = <client hostname>

  1. Restart the client file director

        /etc/init.d/bacula-fd restart
