  - Build

        ikiwiki --setup ikiwiki.setup

  - Rebuild all pages

        ikiwiki --rebuild --setup ikiwiki.setup

  To avoid often commits to wiki due to, for example, the grammar errors or
  poor formating it is possible to make a local wiki sandbox. All changes could
  be viewed there before commiting to git.

  1. Requirements

        aptitude install apache2 ikiwiki

  2. Configuration as root

        ln -s /etc/apache2/mods-available/userdir.* /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/
        /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

  3. Configuration as user (assume that your username pop, locate your git
     branch)

        mkdir public_html
        cd public_html
        mkdir wiki
        ikiwiki --verbose <path_to_branch> ~/public_html/wiki/ --url=http://localhost/~pop/wiki

  Using *public_html* as the name of the directory is required. It can be
  changed at /etc/apache2/mods-available/userdir.conf. Look at UserDir
  directive definition.

  Now you may have access to your wiki at http://localhost/~pop/wiki. Each time
  when you are going to commit changes to repository you may run the command to
  preview you changes:

          ikiwiki <path_to_branch> ~/public_html/wiki/ --url=http://localhost/~pop/wiki

  The last command may be defined as an alias at ~/.bashrc file.

  *Take into account that due to the different location the actual path of your
  file may be different too and index.html files require additional changes.*
