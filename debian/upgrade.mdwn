# Upgrading Debian

  * edit /etc/apt/sources.list
  * run upgrade

        apt-get update;apt-get dist-upgrade

  * get all the necessary keyrings

        apt-get install --force-yes -y potto-archive-keyring
        apt-get install --force-yes -y debian-backports-keyring

  * kill nrpe

        /etc/init.d/nagios-nrpe-server stop
        update-rc.d -f nagios-nrpe-server remove
        /etc/init.d/xinetd restart

  * hope or pray depending on your religious persuasion

  * initscripts, force removal since they are considered config files

        dpkg --purge --force-depends initscripts
        apt-get install initscripts

# Using FAI

  * install fai-client. It is not available on sarge repository, only etch.

  * edit /etc/fai/fai.conf 
  * Modify the following variables:

        FAI_LOGPROTO=ssh
        FAI_CONFIGDIR=/var/fai/config
        FAI_CONFIG_SRC=nfs://backup01$FAI_CONFIGDIR
        MNTPOINT=/mnt/mirror (you may need to create it)
        FAI=/var/lib/fai/config

  * on backup01 edit /var/fai/config/class/50-host-classes
    you have to add the appropriate server and define classes for it.

  * run actual upgrade (if the previous installation was performed using FAI too you can ommit the -N flag)

        fai -v -N softupdate

  * Notes:
    You may need to run the update command a few times. (This is still under consideration)
