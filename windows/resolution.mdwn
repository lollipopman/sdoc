## Blind resolution change

If you can, right click on the desktop, select Properties (or press R). Press
CTRL-Tab four times in a row. Press the Left arrow key 5 or 6 times (you can
only go so low). Then press the Enter Key. This should change your resolution.
If it seems you get another prompt, that you can't see, press Enter again.
