### Issues

I experienced the floppy image issue during WinXP(32-bit) installation. The
libvirt config did not see the floppy image. I was unable to start
installation. The solution was to prepare the image with WinXP and Win2003
through the command line and after the first reboot to push this image to
libvirt. I used the following command:

    /usr/bin/qemu-kvm -boot d \
    -cdrom /home/yyl/distrib/isos/SW_CD_Windows_XP_Professional_32BIT_Enish_ISO_MLF_X15-05160.ISO \
    -drive file=/vm/winxp.qcow2,if=virtio,boot=on \
    -fda /home/yyl/distrib/isos/viostor-31-03-2010-floppy.img \
    -m 1200
