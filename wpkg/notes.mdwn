## Packages

  - priority - specifies a numeric value that determines in what order a 
    package will be installed. The higher the number, the higher the 
    priority, and so the earlier the package will be installed compared 
    with lower priority packages. For example: 
      - 2 - installs these packages 1st
      - 1 - installs these packages 2nd
      - 0 - installs these packages 3rd 

## Printing

  1. Update printers list (printers-to-add.txt). Format is the following:

        \\printserver\<hostname>

  1. To add printers manually type in the Administrator's cmd run:

        runas /user:%computername%\Administrator cmd
        cscript %SOFTWARE%\bin\cups-printers\printer-control.vbs add %SOFTWARE%\bin\cups-printers\printers-to-add.txt

  1. Alternatively run single command in the user's cmd:
			
        runas /user:%computername%\Administrator "cscript %SOFTWARE%\bin\cups-printers\printer-control.vbs add %SOFTWARE%\bin\cups-printers\printers-to-add.txt"

  1. Select the default printer once log in as user

## Installing printer problem

The way to install printers used above is a correct one. Before we had a script which installs network printers per user not per machine. This means you have to run printer-control.vbs for each new user logged to the system and select a default printers. This affects around 80-90% of all machines.

To fix it manually do the following:

  1. Run the following scripts as user (run for each user who was previously logged on the system)

        cscript %SOFTWARE%\bin\cups-printers\printer-control.vbs del %SOFTWARE%\bin\cups-printers\printers-to-add.txt

  1. Run the following scripts as administrator:

        cscript %SOFTWARE%\bin\cups-printers\printer-control-net.vbs del %SOFTWARE%\bin\cups-printers\printers-to-add.txt

      or alternatively in the user cmd

        runas /user:%computername%\Administrator cscript "%SOFTWARE%\bin\cups-printers\printer-control-net.vbs del %SOFTWARE%\bin\cups-printers\printers-to-add.txt"
          
  1. Run the following script as administrator

        cscript %SOFTWARE%\bin\cups-printers\printer-control.vbs add %SOFTWARE%\bin\cups-printers\printers-to-add.txt

    or alternatively run in the user cmd

        runas /user:%computername%\Administrator cscript "%SOFTWARE%\bin\cups-printers\printer-control.vbs add %SOFTWARE%\bin\cups-printers\printers-to-add.txt"
  
  1. Select the default printer
