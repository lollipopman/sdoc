*NOTE*: Disable firewall on the local machine or open 1194 TCP/UDP port
Use 2.1 openvpn version

# Network Manager

    1. aptitude install network-manager network-manager-openvpn
    1. copy provided keys and certs into user directory
    1. create a new openvpn connection
    1. use ovpn.example.com as vpn server

    *Problems*: the default configuration (setuid probably)
    does not allow to set default routes, needs some workaround.

# openvpn

    1. copy provided key and certs int /etc/openvpn/
    1. copy ovpn files to the same directory
    1. rename Chapdelaine and Co.ovpn to Chapdelaine.conf
    1. check the following settings:

      remote ovpn.example.com
      ca ca.crt
      cert <username>.crt
      key <username>.key

    1. (optional) if you did not copy key and certs into /etc/openvpn 
        then you have to change the path to them at the previous step
    1. start openvpn service

    *Problems*: requires to update /etc/resolv.conf:

      before:
        search lollilpoman.org
        domain lollilpoman.org
        nameserver 192.168.1.1

      after:
        search example.com
        domain example.com lollipopman.org
        nameserver 192.168.40.2
        nameserver 192.168.1.1

    Take into account that this file will be overwritten next boot 
    or connect/disconnect action.

# check connection

  ping -I tun0 ns1.example.com
