# troubleshooting

## printer are marked as "unable to connect"

  The reason is that standard user is not able to install any printers.
  You have to log in as local Administrator and make sure that all printers
  are ready (Start -> Printers and Faxes). If some of them are not ready
  refresh list using F5 button. After log in as user again. All printers should
  be able to accept the jobs.

## printer are marked as "unable to connect" on bloomberg machines

  Bloomberg machines use the local account which does not exist in LDAP. To enable 
  printing do the following:

  1. 'Start' -> 'Run'
  1. Type:

      \\printserver

  1. It gives you the authentication dialog
  1. Type *guest* as user and no password
  1. Check box  'Remember password'
  1. Hit OK
  1. Close the window showing the shares on \\printserver
  1. 'Start' -> 'Printers and Faxes'
  1. 'F5' to refresh window content.
