## Setup Samba Printing via Cups Universal Postscript Driver

  1. add to smb.conf

        [global]
          # printing 
          load printers = yes
          printing = cups
          printcap name = cups

        [printers]
          comment = All Printers
          path = /var/spool/samba
          browseable = no
          guest ok = yes
          writable = no
          printable = yes 
          printer admin = +systems

        [print$]
          comment = Printer Drivers
          path = /var/lib/samba/drivers
          browseable = yes
          guest ok = no
          read only = yes
          write list = +systems

  1. grab cups windows driver

    - <www.cups.org> `cups-windows-6.0-1.i386.rpm`
    - `alien --to-tgz cups-windows-6.0-1.i386.rpm`

  1. setup drivers in `/usr/share/cups/drivers/`

        [Windows 2000 and higher]
        cups6.inf (from www.cups.org)
        cups6.ini (from www.cups.org)
        cupsps6.dll (from www.cups.org)
        cupsui6.dll (from www.cups.org)
        ps5ui.dll (from your Windows system)
        pscript.hlp (from your Windows system)
        pscript.ntf (from your Windows system)
        pscript5.dll (from your Windows system)

    *NOTE:* files must be lowercase

  1. add `/var/lib/samba/drivers`

        mkdir -p /var/lib/samba/drivers
        chmod 2775 /var/lib/samba/drivers
        chown root:systems /var/lib/samba/drivers

  1. add `/var/spool/samba`

        mkdir -p /var/spool/samba
        chmod 1777 /var/spool/samba
        chown root:root /var/spool/samba

  1. reload samba `/etc/init.d/samba reload`

  1. run cupsaddsmb from box where you setup the drivers
     as yourself, i.e. jwh

    - all printers

            cupsaddsmb -a -v -H <samba server> -h <cups server>

    - single printer

            cupsaddsmb -v -H <samba server> -h <cups server> <printer name>

						(for example, on nas01):

            cupsaddsmb -v -H printserver -h printserver muni-northeast-hp4015	
							

    *NOTE:* this error can be ignored (the error was not observed
            on Samba 3.4.3 and CUPS 1.4.1):

        tdb_open_ex: could not open file /var/run/samba/gencache.tdb: Permission denied

  1. reload samba to see new printers

        /etc/init.d/samba reload

  1. rejoice in a job well done
  1. cry because it doesn't work
