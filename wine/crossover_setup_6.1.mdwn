# 7.2.3.4. Internet Explorer hangs when I open a new window. Why?

This problem occurs if you installed Internet Explorer on a system that already has a number of Truetype fonts installed, but not in CrossOver's Windows\Fonts directory. If Internet Explorer detects fonts are already present on the system, then it will not install and register them correctly.

Secondly, Internet Explorer contains a bug that will cause hangs if it searches for a font that is in use, but not registered.

To solve this problem, first shutdown all CrossOver processes. After you're sure all there are no more wineserver and wineloader processes, edit the file ~/.cxoffice/dotwine/system.reg. Find the \\CurrentVersion\\Fonts key in the file. Add any of the following entries to it that don't exist already:

[Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Fonts] 986159144
"Arial Black (TrueType)"="ariblk.ttf"
"Comic Sans MS (TrueType)"="comic.ttf"
"Comic Sans MS Bold (TrueType)"="comicbd.ttf"
"Impact (TrueType)"="impact.ttf"
"Verdana (TrueType)"="verdana.ttf"
"Verdana Bold (TrueType)"="verdanab.ttf"
"Verdana Bold Italic (TrueType)"="verdanaz.ttf"
"Verdana Italic (TrueType)"="verdanai.ttf"
"Webdings (TrueType)"="webdings.ttf"

Arial is the most commonly used font, so the first line is the most important.
