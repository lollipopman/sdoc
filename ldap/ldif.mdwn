### LDIF Line Types

  1. DIRECTIVE LINE - a line which starts (in column 1) with any character
     EXCEPT SPACE or # (hash)
  2. CONTINUATION LINE - a line which follows a DIRECTIVE LINE and starts (in
     column 1) with a SPACE - subsequent characters are assumed to be part of
     the previous line. Any number of CONTINUATION lines may exist up to any
     size limit imposed by the attribute.
  3. BLANK LINE - a line which consists of no characters in column 1
     (typically created with the ENTER key). BLANK LINES are typically used to
     separate ENTRY sequences.
  4. COMMENT LINE - a line which starts (in column 1) with a # (hash)
     character.
  5. SEPARATOR LINE - a line which starts (in column 1) with a - (dash)
     character. SEPARATOR LINES are typically used to terminate OPERATOR
     sequences.
