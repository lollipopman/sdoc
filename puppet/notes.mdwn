### Use the FQDN

Because puppet relies on ssl certs for authentication fqdn must be used
everywhere. SSL only works with fqdn's.

### default backup file location

    /var/lib/puppet/bucket

### ca

   - clean cert for a client

        puppetca --clean testdb.foo.com

### SSL problems

    host=mon02.foo.com
    openssl verify -CAfile /var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/ca.pem \
      /var/lib/puppet/ssl/certs/${host}.pem

### set up a seed file

This file is for autoanswering when puppet installs package like sun-java:

  - required:

        apt-get install debconf-utils

  - on working machine:

        apt-get install sun-java6-jre
        # Answer all questions otherwise the below command will output
        # null or wrong string
        debconf-get-selections | grep sun- > sun-java6.seed

After add the responsefile to the package installation configuration and the
seed-file itself into the filebucket directory.
